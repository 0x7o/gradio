# How to add new language support

1. Create a new json file in this directory
2. Name the file after the language code (Here's a list: http://4umi.com/web/html/languagecodes.php)
3. Please provide clear and complete translations. Take a look at the en.json for the corresponding English text.
4. Lastly, the json file will need to be imported and added into `i18n.js` (https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/61fcdaf30cf47706db0b36fceab7d0cb2792b633/ui/packages/app/src/i18n.js)
