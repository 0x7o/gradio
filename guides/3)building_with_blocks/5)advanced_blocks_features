## Adding examples to a Blocks app

In order to add examples to an app written with the Blocks API, you need to use the `gr.Examples` component helper.
This class is a wrapper over the `gr.Dataset` component.

During class creation, `gr.Examples` will instantiate a `gr.Dataset` and attach an event listener on the dataset click event
that will populate all the inputs with the values of that row of the dataset. 

To show this in practice, we will build the same calculator but with Blocks instead of an Interface.

$code_calculator_blocks
$demo_calculator_blocks

By the way, Interface uses `gr.Examples` under the hood too!
So if you know how this example works you also know how the Interface examples work! ðŸ¥³
